## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `rct_power`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/rct_power/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "RCT Power"

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text

custom_components/rct_power/translations/nb.json
