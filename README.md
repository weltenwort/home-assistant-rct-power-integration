**This component will set up the following platforms.**

| Platform | Description                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `sensor` | Show info from RCT Power API. |

## Installation

### Via the HACS integration

1. Install the "RCT Power" integration using [HACS].
2. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "RCT Power"

### Via manual download

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `rct_power`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/rct_power/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "RCT Power"

## Configuration

Upon installation the integration accepts the following configuration parameters:

- `Host name`: The local IP address or host name of the inverter.
- `Port`: The port of the inverter's API, defaults to `8899`.
- `Name`: This name is used as a prefix to the entities created by this integration and can be used to disambiguate multiple inverters.

After installation the integration allows for the following configuration parameters to be changed:

- `Frequent polling interval`: The polling interval in seconds for entities updated frequently, defaults to `30`.
- `Infrequent polling interval`: The polling interval in seconds for entities updated infrequently, defaults to `180`.
- `Static polling interval`: The polling interval in seconds for entities updated seldomly, defaults to `3600`.

## Usage with the built-in energy dashboard

You can use the entities provided by this integration on Home Assistant's
built-in energy dashboard. For that purpose, navigate to "Configuration" ->
"Energy" and choose the following entities.

Please note that the entity names in your installation are prefixed with the
inverter name chosen during installation of the integration, so interpret the
entity names mentioned below to be entity name suffixes.

Also note that after configuration the energy dashboard might take several hours
to show any data, because Home Assistant calculates the underlying statistics
only on an hourly basis.
